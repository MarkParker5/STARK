# Welcome to S.T.A.R.K.

## Speech and Text Algorithmic Recognition Kit

Welcome to S.T.A.R.K., a modern, advanced, asynchronous, and fast framework designed for creating intuitive natural language interfaces, especially voice-based. Think of it as the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) but with speech instead of http.

New to S.T.A.R.K.? Consider reading the articles in navigation sequentially for a comprehensive understanding of the framework, including the "Advanced" section.
